# 🏡 Machine Learning with Python: Linear Regression with One Variable

## 📌 Problem Statement
We are given data on home prices in Monroe Township, New Jersey, based on the square footage of homes. The objective is to build a machine learning model using Single Linear Regression that can predict home prices given the square footage.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of:
| 📏 Square Feet | 💰 Price (USD) |
|-------------|------------|
| 1500        | 300000     |
| 1800        | 360000     |
| 2400        | 480000     |
| 3000        | 540000     |
| 3500        | 640000     |

## 🔍 Approach
1. **📌 Data Visualization**:  
   - 📈 Plot the data using a scatter plot.  
   - 🔴 Use red markers to represent actual data points.  
2. **🧠 Single Linear Regression Model**:  
   - 📉 Train a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.  
   - 🏗 Fit the model to the dataset.  
   - 📏 Plot the best-fit line.  
3. **📡 Prediction**:  
   - 🏡 Use the trained model to predict house prices for given square footage values.  

## ⚙️ Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
