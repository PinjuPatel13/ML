# Machine Learning with Python: Linear Regression with One Variable

## Problem Statement
We are given data on home prices in Monroe Township, New Jersey, based on the square footage of homes. The objective is to build a machine learning model using Single Linear Regression that can predict home prices given the square footage.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
| Square Feet | Price (USD) |
|-------------|------------|
| 1500        | 300000     |
| 1800        | 360000     |
| 2400        | 480000     |
| 3000        | 540000     |
| 3500        | 640000     |

## Approach
1. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Plot the data using a scatter plot.  
   - Use red markers to represent actual data points.  
2. **Single Linear Regression Model**:  
   - Train a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.  
   - Fit the model to the dataset.  
   - Plot the best-fit line.  
3. **Prediction**:  
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices for given square footage values.
